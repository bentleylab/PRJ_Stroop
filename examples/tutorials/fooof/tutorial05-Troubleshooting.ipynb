        "FOOOF Settings\n--------------\n\nWith default settings, FOOOF is minimally constrained. It defaults as such since there are not universal settings that work across all different dataset modalities. Appropriate settings also vary with power spectrum quality (noise, or effectively, the smoothness of the power spectrum), and frequency ranges.\n\nFor any given dataset, FOOOF will likely need some tuning of parameters for optimal performance.\n\nTo do so, we suggest using a combination of the following considerations:\n- A priori constraints, given your data, such as the number of peaks you expect to extract\n- Qualitative analysis, guided by examing the the plotted model fit results, as compared to input data\n- Quantitative analysis, considering the model fit and error (however, see note at the bottom regarding interpreting model fit error)\n\nTuning FOOOF is an imperfect art, and should be done carefully, as assumptions built into the settings chosen will impact the model results.\n\nWe also recommend that FOOOF settings should not be changed between power spectra (across channels, trials, or subjects), if they are to be meaningfully compared. We therefore recommend first testing out FOOOF across some representative spectra, in order to select FOOOF settings, which you then keep constant for the full analysis.\n\n"

If you move to a new dataset, you may also find you need to relax some settings, for better fits. You also need to make sure you pick an appropriate aperiodic fitting procedure, and that your data meets the assumptions of the approach you choose.\n\nThe remainder of this notebook goes through some examples of setting FOOOF parameters to be most appropriate for various datasetes.\n\n"

        "Interpreting Model Fit Quality Measures\n---------------------------------------\n\nFOOOF calculates and returns a couple metrics to assist with assessing the quality of the model fits. It calculates both the model fit error, as the root mean-squared error (RMSE) between the full model fit ('fooofed\\_spectrum\\_)' and the original power spectrum, as well as the R-squared correspondance between the original spectrum and the FOOOFed result.\n\nThese scores can be used to assess how the model is performing. However interpreting these measures requires a bit of nuance. FOOOF is NOT optimized to minimize fit error / maximize r-squared at all costs. To do so typically results in fitting a large number of gaussian processes, in a way that overfits noise.\n\nFOOOF is therefore tuned to try and measure the aperiodic signal and peaks in a parsimonious manner, such as to not overfit noise, and following a fuzzy definition of only fitting peaks where there are actually significant peaks over and above the aperiodic signal, and the noise. One way we tested this is by assessing the model as compared to how expert human raters labeled putative oscillatory 'peaks'. As such, overall the model is not directly designed to optimize model fit error / r-squared.\n\nGiven this, while high error / low r-squared may indicate a poor model fit, very low error / high r-squared may also indicate a power spectrum that is overfit, in particular in which the peak parameters from the model may reflect overfitting by modelling too many peaks, and thus not offer a good description of the underlying data.\n\nWe therefore recommend that, for a given dataset, initial explorations should involve checking both cases in which model fit error is particularly large, as well as when it is particularly low. These explorations can be used to set parameters that are suitable for running across a group. There are not universal parameters that optimize this, and so FOOOF leaves it up to the user to set parameters appropriately to not under- or over-fit for a given modality / dataset / application.\n\n"

        "Aperiodic Signal Fitting\n------------------------\n\nFOOOF currently offers two approaches for fitting the aperiodic 'background':\n\n- Fitting with just an offset and a slope, equivalent to a linear fit in log-log space\n    - background_mode = 'fixed'\n- Including a 'knee' parameter, reflecting a fit with a bend, in log-log space\n    - background_mode = 'knee'\n\nFitting without a knee assumes a single linear 1/f like characteristic to aperiodic signal, in log-log space. Fitting will go wrong if this assumption is violated. In particular, broad frequency ranges (often, greater than ~40 Hz range) don't meet this criterion, as they also exhibit a 'bend' in the aperiodic signal. For these cases, fitting should be done using a 'knee' parameter.\n\nFitting with a knee is still experimental, with a couple outstanding issues:\n- Interpreting the fit results when using knee fits is more complex, as the slope result is no longer a simple measure of a singular property, but rather reflects the slope past the 'knee' inflecting point, and as such, knee & slope values should be considered together.\n- Fitting FOOOF with knee fits may perform sub-optimally in ambiguous cases (where the data may or may not have a knee).\n\nGiven this, we recommend:\n\n- Check your data, across the frequency range of interest, for what the aperiodic signal looks like.\n    - If it looks roughly linear (in log-log space), fit without a knee.\n        - This is likely across smaller frequency ranges, such as 3-30.\n        - Do not perform no-knee fits across a range in which this does not hold.\n    - If there is a clear knee, then use knee fits.\n        - This is likely across larger fitting ranges such as 1-150 Hz.\n- Be wary of ambiguous ranges, where there may or may not be a knee.\n    - Trying to fit without a knee, when there is not a single consistent aperiodic signal, can lead to very bad fits. But it is also a known issue that trying to fit with a knee can lead to suboptimal fits when no knee is present.\n        - We therefore currently recommend picking frequency ranges in which the expected aperiodic signal process is relatively clear.\n\n"
