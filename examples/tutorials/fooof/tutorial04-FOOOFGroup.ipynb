Most likely, a FOOOFGroup will be run across a collection of spectra from across channels, and/or across trials, within or across subjects.\n\nThe main difference with the FOOOFGroup object, is that it also contains a 'power_spectra' attribute, which stores the matrix of power-spectra to be fit, and collects fit results into a 'group_results' attribute. Otherwise, FOOOFGroup supports all the same functionality, accessed in the same way as the FOOOF object.\n\nInternally, it runs the exact same fitting procedure, per spectrum, as the FOOOF object.\n\n"

If you set this parameter to some other integer, fitting will launch 'n_jobs' number of jobs, in parallel. Setting n_jobs to -1 will launch in parallel across all available cores.\n\nNote, however, that running FOOOF in parallel does not gaurantee a quicker runtime overall. The computation time per FOOOF-fit scales with the frequency range fit over, and the 'complexity' of the power spectra, in terms of number of peaks. For relatively small numbers of power spectra (less than ~100), across relatively small frequency ranges (say ~3-40Hz), running in parallel may offer no appreciable speed up.\n\n"
